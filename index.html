<h2><br>
  You're coming to this website probably expecting me to bash Comic Sans, well I'm not. I'm here to tell you about Comic Sans and where it came from. Comic Sans was invented by a person who worked at the Microsoft Corporation named Vincent Connare, he wanted something that would look more authentic and more approachable after seeing something like Times New Roman not being suitable for most documents and pieces of writing, during 1993 he was developing the font. Making it's debut in Windows 95 included as one of the system fonts in the package. It gained a lot of positive reception due to how simplistic and just generally fun it looks, It gained much critical acclaim and was heavily used since then until the early to mid 2000s. </h2>
