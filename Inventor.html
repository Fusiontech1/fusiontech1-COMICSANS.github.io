<h2><br>
 The inventor of Comic Sans is Vincent Connare who worked at the Microsoft Corporation. Vincent started working for Microsoft after he created a font pack for them which led to a job. During this time he was working on a font called Comic Sans and finished it in 1994. he created it with the intention of having a fun font and one that would be most suitable for a lot of documentations. Microsoft liked it so much they decided to include it in their new main OS Windows 95. It garnered a lot of love and attention at least until the early to mid 2000s. Vincent Connare left Microsoft in 1999 to work on his Masters degree at the university of reading. He has stated several times since then that Comic Sans is a good font even though he's only used his typeface once and that if you don't like Comic Sans you don't know anything about design.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
