When you read everything that was typed up it'd be in Comic Sans, it got so bad that a democratic party in Canada made a petition to ban Comic Sans from being used along with pockets of people around the world. The main arguments are it's overused, it's ugly and it's hard to look at. Vincent has said if you love Comic Sans you don't know anything about Typography but if you hate Comic Sans, you also don't know anything about Typography. By the late 2000s the font completely died out and has become irrelevant.</h4>&nbsp;</td>
